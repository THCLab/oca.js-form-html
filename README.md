## Overview

A component based upon [OCA form core](https://github.com/THCLab/oca.js-form-core) that renders pure HTML from OCA schema bundle. This lib aims to stay 100% dependency free in terms of any frontend related libs. It assumes that any form styling will be done using custom CSS and therefore does not enforce to use any modern CSS framework. 

Existing bindings to popular CSS frameworks:
* [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/): https://github.com/THCLab/oca.js-form-quasar
